The following is an attempt to process region of interest only. Such a process would require segmenting a full resolution mammogram into smaller segments of 400 by 400 and checking each individual sub-image. This effort was abandoned in favor of the cc-mlo model but helped introduce me to both vgg16 and vgg19 models.
